USING 'DIFF'
Comparing two files without the help of software is tedious.
Fortunately, the usage of the command 'diff' facilitates this work.
I can use diff file1 file2 in the command line to find all the differences 
between two files. The parameter -u gives a uniform output of the 
differences.

PRIMITIVE VERSION CONTROL
By saving all changes in different files is one way of version control. 

COMMITTS OF WHOLE REPOSITORY
The whole repostitory is updated by a new commit because in many cases
the files are not independent so that a change in one file affects the other
files.

GIT CLONE
To clone a repository, one can use the command ’git clone’ followed by a space
and the repsitory URL. 

GIT LOG
Returns all commits.

GIT CHECKOUT
Allows to go back to previous versions to figure out in which commit a certain 
bug was introduced.

MAKING CHANGES
Since one can always go back, changes that possibly can break something are
not to bad.

INITIALIZING A REPOSITORY
When a repostitory is initialized, an empty repostitory is created and 
the repository is given an adress at the storage.

STAGING AREA
The staging area is between the working directory and the repsitory.
If one wants to commit more than one file and one file is already ready for
commiting it can copied into the staging area.
